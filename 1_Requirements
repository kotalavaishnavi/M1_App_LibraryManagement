# **Requirements**
## Introduction

The purpose of a library management system is to operate a library with efficiency and at reduced costs. The system being entirely automated streamlines all the tasks involved in operations of the library. The activities of book purchasing, cataloging, indexing, circulation recording and stock checking are done by the software. Such software eliminates the need for repetitive manual work and minimizes the chances of errors.
 The purpose of this application are as follows:
 
.  The software is for automation of library.

.  It provides following facilities to Operator.

.  Can enter details related to a particular book.

.  Can enter details related to a particular student/user.

.  Can read and write information about any member.

.  Can update, create, delete the record of membership as per requirement and implementation plants.

# **Research**

 With the advancement of technology, it is imperative to exalt all the systems into a user-friendly manner. The Library Management system (LMS) acts as a tool to transform traditional libraries into digital libraries. In traditional libraries, the students/user has to search for books which are hassle process and there is no proper maintenance of database about issues/fines. The overall progress of work is slow and it is impossible to generate a fast report. 
 The librarians have to work allotted for arranging, sorting books in the book sells. At the same time, they have to check and monitor the lend/borrow book details with its fine. It is a tedious process to work simultaneously in different sectors. LMS will assist the librarians to work easily. The LMS supports the librarians to encounter all the issues concurrently. The users need not stand in a queue for a long period to return/borrow a book from the library. The single PC contains all the data's in it.
